    <h2>Instructions</h2>
  
    <article>
        <h3>1. Prepare the Dough:</h3>
        <p>
            In a small bowl, dissolve the sugar in warm water. Sprinkle the yeast over the water and let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until it becomes foamy. In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt. Make a well in the center and pour in the yeast mixture and olive oil. Stir until a dough forms. Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 5 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic. Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover with a clean kitchen towel, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour or until doubled in size.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Preheat the Oven:</h3>
        <p>
            Preheat your oven to 450°F (230°C). If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven to preheat as well. If not, you can use a baking sheet.
        </p>
    </article>
  
    <article>
        <h3>3. Shape and Top the Pizza:</h3>
        <p>
            Once the dough has doubled in size, punch it down and divide it into two equal portions. Roll out each portion into a circle on a floured surface. Transfer the dough to a pizza peel or parchment paper-lined baking sheet. Spread tomato sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges. Sprinkle shredded mozzarella cheese over the sauce, then add pepperoni slices, sliced mushrooms, diced green bell pepper, and sliced black olives. Season with dried oregano and crushed red pepper flakes according to your taste.
        </p>
    </article>

        <h3>4. Bake the Pizza:</h3>
        <p>
            Carefully transfer the topped pizza to the preheated pizza stone or baking sheet in the oven. Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbly and melted.
        </p>
    </article>
  
    <article>
        <h3>5. Serve:</h3>
        <p>
            Once the pizza is baked, remove it from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before slicing. Serve hot and enjoy your delicious homemade pizza!
